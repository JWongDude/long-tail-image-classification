Todo:
- re-upload the json files with train/test names ~_~
(Almost there)
Need to access images on remote gpu relative to datastore path.
Do two things:
- Update the Dataset object to access image from datastore path 
- Update the json paths -- remove the front: "./{dataset_name}/"
|-- Update the other json files and upload to GridAI.

- start the training schedule

All is well:
- Clean modeling notebook
- Clean GridAI Runs and Datastores
- Remove the old repo
- Create smart-bagging harness
- Create hyperparameter yaml file

---------------
Time permitting:
- Try a MAML model
- Implement simple image export of confusion matrix
- Double Loss

(But lots of focus will be on building presentation slides)
