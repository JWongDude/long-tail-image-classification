Todo:
- Write Scripts
- environment / requirements.txt

- get on github 
(delete the logs before you push)

- re-upload the json files with train/test names ~_~
(Modifying and putting in dummy dataset now)

- start the training schedule
- make sure the da works


All is well:
- Clean modeling notebook
- Clean GridAI Runs and Datastores
- Remove the old repo
- Create smart-bagging harness

---------------
Time permitting:
- Try a MAML model
- Implement simple image export of confusion matrix
- Double Loss

(But lots of focus will be on building presentation slides)
